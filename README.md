# ML STOCKS in python

## Quickstart

We also have a google colab we are setting up as we are unsure of how to get jupyterlab to work.

However, you must drag in:

```bash
ppo_stock_trading_model.zip
stock_test.csv
```

Pull from this repo and save it to whatever file name

Example:
```bash
cd Users/User/Desktop/MLStocks
```

Open up VSC with python 3.6 and create a new virtual environment with the file as the project.

Then, run the following in terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If the above does not work for whatever reason, contact Jeremy Chang (jeremsc2@uci.edu)

Then, run stock_prediction.py

We already have a trained model, so the training and saving the model is commented out.
